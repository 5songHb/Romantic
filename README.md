# For a programmer's romantic
This code is developed for programmers to show your romantic in a programmer's way.
Feel free to modify and persent it to anyone you care.

# Instructions
There are 5 parts easy to customize:

1. index.html: text displayed on the left side
2. index.html: when the "flower heart" shows up, etc
3. index.html: the action when you click on the "dog". Default: present a video
4. background.jpg: full screen background
5. functions_dev.js: controls fine details of the "flower heart", and the start of the timer

# Credits
Some images and the default video is borrowed from [Tiffany.co](tiffany.co), 
so please don't use for business purposes without their permission.

Inspired by [Hacker Zhou](hackerzhou.me) though code is modified a lot.

"Flow heart" effect credits to the FlowerPower project.
